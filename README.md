## Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

* Frontend: [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Semantic-UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)
* Backend: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* Database: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* GIT: [For versioning control]()
* GitHub: [For managing repositories]()
* Cloudinary: [  For storing images]()
* Deployment: [ Heroku]()
