## Getting Started

This repository aims to assist you in beginning work on Sociofy application with a solid file structure as a foundation. This project will hold both the client application and the server application in single place because we are using NextJS and there is a way in NextJS to create custom server that can accomodate the backend as well and thus we have single node module . First run npm install from the root. From now on run this command anytime you want to install all modules again. This is a script we have defined in package.json .

This app is deployed directly to heroku since there is a script defined in package.json which will automatically handle building and deploying the app. For more information on deploying to heroku reference the extra resources at the bottom of this file.


## Installation

Clone the project

    git clone https://github.com/pesto-students/sociofy-f3-alpha-2.git

Go to the project directory

     cd sociofy-f3-alpha-2
## Run Locally

 

Start the server

     npm run dev
     
Runs both the client app and the server app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view the client in the browser.


    npm run build
    
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

If deploying to heroku this does not need to be run since it is handled by the heroku-postbuild script
 



 
## Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

* Frontend: [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Semantic-UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)
* Backend: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* Database: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* GIT: [For versioning control]()
* GitHub: [For managing repositories]()
* Cloudinary: [  For storing images]()
* Deployment: [ Heroku]()
